1. Introduction
---------------
The RoverControl daemon is repsonsible for the following tasks:
 - reacting to sensor data
 - determining rover moevements
 - executing "missions"
 - reacting to power status
 - reacting to commands from base station

The RoverControl daemon monitors sensor data from the Navigation and Sensor
Daemons and will react to environmental changes as they come up using
behaviours defined in the RoverControl class. The RoverControl daemon also
supports the completion of defined missions received from the base station.
